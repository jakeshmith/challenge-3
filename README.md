# Random Password Generator
By: Jake Smith

## Project Description
In this project, I was given complete HTML starter code, and tasked with resolving the issue of writing JavaScript so that a random password generator would become operable.
Using it, a user can set the length of how long they want the password to be, as well as what kinds of characters they want to use. 

## Tools Used
I primarily utilized JavaScript to do this, though I also used my knowlege of HTML and how it wraps into JavaScript as well. My classmates were able to help me get some extra eyes on it,
and I had to borrow my roommate's laptop charger because I left mine in another state.
